% Fill in the key (you can use anything) and at least the title, author, journal/booktitle, year fields. 
% For journal and booktitle, please use the standard acronym (PAMI, CVPR, etc.) without { } nor " ".
% If your journal / conference is not known by the script, you can add it to the image_Bibtex.js file (see the expanded_venues array) OR
%  simply give the name in { }

% For the other fields:

% - img (optional but highly recommended): Add your image to the repository in the images/papers directory (remember to do git add your file) and put the filename for the value of field img. 
%   Use relatively small images, otherwise loading the page will become slow (max 400x400 pixels). Only give the filename (no url, no path).

% - pdf (optional but but even more recommended): A link to a pdf of your paper. arXiv and the conference website if the pdfs are public are probably the most resilient places.

% - project (optional): Provide a link to a project page related to your paper.

% - note (optional): Anything brief you want to mention (e.g. "To appear", "The two first authors have equal contributions").

% - presentation (optional): e.g. "Oral", "Spotlight".

% - tldr (optional): Too Long Didnt Read. 1 sentence describing your paper.
